# SeedX AI Agents

## This project is a prototype implementation of a Multi-Agent AI System designed for a marketing company. The system demonstrates how multiple specialized AI agents can collaborate via an API to assist with marketing-related tasks through conversational and data-driven workflows.

## The focus is on building an extensible architecture where agents interact and share information, showcasing:

- Modular and clear agent roles

- Traceable multi-agent conversations

- Data-driven responses based on mocked datasets
